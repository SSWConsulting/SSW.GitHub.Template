# Overview 
This template provides users with a default set of issue templates to work with so that they are ready to integrate with the new GitHub Projects.

Use these issues and labels to add flexibility to work in a Scrum manner from GitHub projects.

You can then use fields in GitHub projects to add estimates, task status, sprints and more.
